********************Movixx**************
firstly we are using vite becuase vite is faster than reactjs 
How faster ? 
Ans : Vite is a build tool and development server for front-end projects.
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is not a build tool or a development server like Vite.

/********* untils -> api.js ***********/
Axios library is a popular JavaScript library for making HTTP requests.
in this file we call api using .env file token 
export fetchDataFromApi, which is a function that takes two parameters:
 url and params. This function will be used to make HTTP GET requests to the TMDb API.

/*********/
when we write code in React.StrictMode then everythings calls twice becuase it's checking ki pahili bar jo response aa rha tha agalibar bhi same aa rha ki nhi

/*** Store folder ****/ in this folder we store all the code related to redux store
//redux ko use krne ke liye hame react me 2 package chahiye hote hai 1.redux-toolkit 2.react-redux
//store nam ke folder me redux ka code likh denge store.js file me and usako use kr lenge main file provider ke sath
<Provider store={store}>
        <App />
    </Provider> yese
///*****homeSlice*****/
In the file homeSlice -> the code  is an example of using Redux Toolkit to define a Redux slice, which includes the state, reducers, 
and actions for managing a specific portion of the Redux store.

export const { getApiConfiguration, getGenres } = homeSlice.actions; :- exporting actions

//read again api call and redux store wala kam

//now start writing code gor making website 
//why scss is better than css
ans:SCSS consists of more advanced features, and thus, it can perform more advanced functions. 
A regular CSS language does not assign various nested rules. The SCSS language promotes rules that are properly nested
contentWrapper :- we use contentWrapper for giving same kind of css to all element that's why we wrap all content in contentWrapper.
HeroBanner:-welcome ,to big searchbar background image sabka code isame likha hai
we are write normal code for making these mentioned thing and use hook->useFetch for background

we can;t direct access image url so we need to store it ,for build image url we need 3 -data
(base url,size and file_path)

React Icons: The BsFillArrowLeftCircleFill and BsFillArrowRightCircleFill icons from react-icons/bs are used to represent left and right navigation arrows for scrolling the carousel.

React Router DOM: The useNavigate hook is used to handle navigation to different routes when an item in the carousel is clicked.

React Redux (useSelector): useSelector is used to access data from the Redux store. It retrieves the url property from the home state, which might be used for constructing URLs for images or links.

dayjs: dayjs is a library for parsing and formatting dates and times. It's used to format release dates in a more user-friendly format.

		PosterFallback is an image that serves as a fallback in case a poster image is not available.
